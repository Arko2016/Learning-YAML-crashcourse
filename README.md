This repo has the beginner friendly info about YAML file format. Enough to get started working with YAML files.

### 1. Human-Readable Format:
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It uses indentation to define structure, making it similar in appearance to Python or plain text.
### 2. Key-Value Pairs:
YAML primarily uses key-value pairs, where the key and value are separated by a colon and a space. For example:
```
name: John Doe
age: 30
```
